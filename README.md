## 🌿 Why Flourish?

Most plant care apps are glorified reminders that treat every plant the same. **Flourish is different.**

We've built an AI agent that actually understands your plants - monitoring their health, predicting problems before they happen, and creating dynamic care schedules that evolve based on how your plants respond. No more guesswork, no more dead plants.

### ✨ What Makes It Special

🧠 **Intelligent Monitoring**  
Our AI continuously analyzes your plants' health metrics and environmental conditions, spotting issues before they become problems.

📸 **Multi-Modal Analysis**  
Take a photo of your plant and get instant health assessments, disease identification, and personalized care recommendations.

🎯 **Adaptive Scheduling**  
Care plans that learn and adjust based on your plants' actual responses - not generic timers that ignore reality.

💬 **Expert AI Assistant**  
Chat with our plant care expert AI for instant answers about watering, lighting, diseases, and more.

📊 **Garden Dashboard**  
Beautiful visualizations of your garden's overall health with actionable insights and progress tracking.
